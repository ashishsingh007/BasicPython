String: Unicode to store strings

List : A list is ordered and changeable, unlike strings. We can add duplicate values as well. To declare a list we use the square brackets []

        Method Name 	                       Property     
        clear()	                    removes all the elements from the list
        copy()	                    returns a copy of the list
        extend()	                  add the elements of the list to the end of the current list lst1.extend(lst)
        append()                    add a value into the list at the ednd
        count()	                    returns the number of elements of the specified value
        index()	                    returns the index of the element
        pop()	                      removes the element from the specified position
        remove()	                  removes the item with the specified value
        sort()	                    sorts the list
        reverse()	                  returns the reversed list
 
 Tuples: Tuple is a collection which is unchangeable or immutable. It is ordered and the values can be accessed using the index values. A tuple can have duplicate values as well. 
 To declare a tuple we use the round brackets ().
 Count & index is available method in tuples.
 
 Sets: A set is a collection which is unordered,  it does not have any indexes as well. To declare a set in python we use the curly brackets.
        myset = {10, 20 , 30 ,40, 50, 50}
       Method Name	Property
clear()	clears the items from a set
copy()	returns the copy of the set
difference()	returns a set with the difference of the two sets
isdisjoint()	returns if the sets have intersection
issubset()	returns if the set is a subset
symmetricdifference()	returns a set with the symmetric difference
update()	update the sets with union of the set


Dictionary : dictionary is just like any other collection array in python. But they have key value pairs. A dictionary is unordered and changeable. 
  We use the keys to access the items from a dictionary. To declare a dictionary, we use the curly brackets.
  Method Name	Property
copy()	returns a copy of the dictionary
clear()	clears the dictionary
items()	returns a list containing tuple of key value pairs
keys()	returns a list containing all the keys
update()	updates the dictionary with all the key-value pairs
values()	returns a list of all the values in a dictionary
setdefault()	returns the value of a specified key

Range : for x in range(10):
          print(x)
          
 Type Casting is another important concept of any programming language
