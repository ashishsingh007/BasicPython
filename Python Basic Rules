1) Python is Case Sensitive. For Example --> ls_list & LS_LIST both will be treated two different variable
2) For path specification, Python uses Forward Slashes. If you are accessing file then python will understand C:/folderA/folderB not C:\folderA\folderB
3) There is no command to terminate any statement so no semicolon ; or anything. Simply we can write print("Hello World")
4) In one line only single line should be write to execute. but if you want to write to statement then use semicolon ; as below.
    print("Ashish Singh - 1st"); print("Ashish Singh - 2nd")
5) A string literals can be declare in single quotes '', double quote "",''' """ tripple quotes
6) ANy statement can be commented using # in python 
7) Line Continutaion can be done using \ like
    sum = 123 + \
          100 + \
          50
     Expression enclosed in (), [],{} does not need any \ for line continuation
 8) Blank line b/w program is ignored
 9) Indentation is key part of python like other programming language has {} etc
